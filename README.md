# Introduction

This is an example Node.js app I wrote using CoffeeScript, Express and Jade. So far I have it running locally against Node 0.6.5 but I haven't had any luck deploying to Heroku as it only support 0.4.7 (at least what I can tell from their documentation).

# Installation

- clone repository
- run ```npm install``` to install packages (CoffeeScript, Express and Jade)
- run ```coffee web.coffee``` or ```node web.js``` to start the application
